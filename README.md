# raspberry-pi-cloud-storage
We built a self-hosted cloud using Raspberry Pi 5, Nextcloud, and Tailscale. Initially accessed via LAN, we later used Tailscale Funnel to enable secure global accessâ€”no static IP or port forwarding needed. A 120GB USB drive was mounted as external storage to test personal cloud functionality in a compact, cost-effective setup.
